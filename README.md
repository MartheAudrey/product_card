## My process

1. Understand the challenge
2. Build the HTML structure
3. Style everything with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. How CSS grid can be used to style elements organized in only one column

```css
.container .text-container{
    padding: 1.5rem;
    font-family: "Montserrat-Regular";
    color: var(--grey);
    display: grid;
    gap: 1rem;
}
```
